;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Like ido-find-file, lusty-explorer, helm/anything, etc. But none of them
;; did quite what I wanted so I created this. The goal is to navigate the file 
;; system as fast as possible. Like a much faster way of doing the...
;; 
;;  1. cd <foo>
;;  2. ls
;;  3. goto 1
;;  
;;  ...loop in the shell.
;;
;;
;; You'll likely want to change some of the key bindings. Just redefine the keys
;; on jg-quicknav-mode-map. For example, if you use C-n for something else and want
;; to move up and down lines while navigating with M-n instead, use this:
;;
;; (define-key jg-quicknav-mode-map (kbd "C-n") nil)
;; (define-key jg-quicknav-mode-map (kbd "M-n") 'jgqn-next)
;; 
;;
;; TODO:
;; - add a command/keybinding to create new file in current directory
;; - when updating results, clamp the selection index to the number of results
;;   so it doesn't disappear off the end
;; - different face/color for executables? or just the "*"?
;; - hotkey to go directly to dired?
;; - use save-excursion instead of kill-window?
;; - make it work remotely? with TRAMP maybe?
;; - shell-mode plugin to "cd" to a directory chosen via jgqn?
